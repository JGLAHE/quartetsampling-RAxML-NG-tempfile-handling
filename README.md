# Quartet Sampling (w/ better RAxML-NG tempfile handling for runs with large --reps & --max-random-sample-proportion) #

![alt text](https://github.com/FePhyFoFum/quartetsampling/blob/master/doc/logo.png)

Quartet Sampling is a method to analyze molecular phylogenies by calculating branch support using repeated sampling of quartets.  Quartet Sampling differs from other support methods by combining a set of of tests into a single, efficient framework to address phylogenetic discordance.  QS is particularly useful for very large and data-sparse alignments or large phylogenomic datasets.

## This Fork ##
For runs with large --reps & --max-random-sample-proportion that select RAxML-NG as the engine, superfluous RAxML-NG job files are deleted as they're generated, c.f. the master branch where they accumulate until the end of the run. For my own dataset of ~500 loci (--reps > 3000, --max-random-sample-proportion > 0.5) this amounted to >1TB over the course of a run (which had to be provisioned for). The same dataset can be kept at ~12GB using the version in this fork; this is easier to fit/run in RAM.

## Update Version 1.3.1 ##
Version 1.3.1 - Adds RESULTS.node.count.csv that provides counts and representative topologies for the three quartet arragements.  This is useful when QD is low in determining the more common discordant option.

## Usage ##

For complete details, see the manual for Quartet Sampling (https://github.com/FePhyFoFum/quartetsampling/blob/master/quartetsampling.pdf).

## NEW! Visualization ##

Shuiyin Liu has created a new R-script that can visualize QS results:
